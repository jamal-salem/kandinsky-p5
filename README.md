# Kandinsky p5.js 

A generative abstract art project inspired by the style of Wassily Kandinsky,  
implemented using JavaScript and the p5.js library.

## Concept
This project explores how abstract geometric art can be translated into
code-based visual compositions. The artwork is generated using circles,
lines, angles, and carefully balanced colors to resemble a Kandinsky-style
composition.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- p5.js
- HTML5 Canvas
- Git & GitHub Pages

## Features
- Code-generated geometric composition
- Layered shapes and color harmony
- Subtle animation for visual liveliness
- Basic user interaction (mouse-based control)
- Clean and organized project structure
